# A-Algorithm-Graph-Traversal
This C++ code follows the A* algorithm in traversing a graph that is inputted to the program in a text file in the form of a matrix (For each index i,j the weight of the edge is the value of the Matrix[i][j]). It finds the minimum spanning tree to traverse the graph using Priority Queues and Sets classes.
